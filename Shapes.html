      <li>Give them a sheet of stickers and have them match the stickers to colored paper.</li>
      <li>Also, watch episodes from Daniel Tiger, Super Why, Baby Genius and other educational toddler programs that mention and teach colors will help a lot too.</li>

      <li>Get an old egg carton and paint it different colors. Using buttons or other small objects, have your toddler sort them.</li>
      <li>Dye Easter Eggs together. Also, when they go Easter Egg Hunting ask them to name the colored eggs they find.</li>
      <li>f they love playing with cars you could make a color coordinated parking lot and teach them to park the cars on the correct spot.</li>
      <li>Make little x’s on a paper with colors, and have the children match the corresponding colored stickers to each X.</li>
      <li>Sort items like fruit loops or fruity cheerios onto the right color papers.</li>

      <li>Get colored magnets for the fridge and have them tell you the colors, or group them into colors while you are preparing food. This is also an excellent way to teach children to read. Have your child tell you the letter and the sound of each magnet.
        Also, have them or group them into easy words while you are preparing food, doing the dishes, or spending time in the kitchen</li>
      <li>Decorate cookies with colored frosting and sprinkles.</li>
      <li>A favorite family activity is to blow up balloons of different colors.Telling a toddler to ‘hit the purple or red balloon’ helps them learn colors through play.</li>
