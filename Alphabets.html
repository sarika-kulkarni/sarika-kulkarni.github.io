      <li> <strong>Read, read, and read. </strong>Read nursery rhymes, rhyming books, picture books and chapter books. Just READ.</li>
      <li> <strong>Notice print in the world around you. </strong>Call attention to exit signs, the toothpaste tube, and the Cheerios box.</li>
      <li> <strong>Begin letter learning by helping your child learn the letters of his name.</strong> Before I start a more organized approach to teaching the alphabet to my preschoolers, they learn to recognize the letters of their name.</li>
      <li> <strong> Teach the alphabet letter by letter.</strong> Not every early childhood teacher uses the Letter of the Week approach; many children learn their alphabet without it. But I’ve found that Letter of the Week has been a helpful structure for
        me when designing learning activities at home.<br>If you take one week per letter, you’ll have time to: read books for each letter, do fine motor activities, learn simple rhymes and songs, create some fun crafts and art projects, make math connections,
        have some sensory fun. </li>
      <li> <strong>Be flexible.</strong> You may find that after a few months of letter of the week, your child suddenly recognizes every letter. Awesome! Don’t feel tied to this series. Pick and choose what (if any) activities you’d like to continue with.
        Even if you don’t continue Letter of the Week, your child will still benefit from listening to the many wonderful books.</li>
      <li> <strong>Keep it fun.</strong> One way to keep your alphabet learning enjoyable is to include music. We love listening to Heidisongs’ alphabet songs for the car (the DVD option is great too!). Also remember that kids this age learn best through play.
        They don’t need fancy flash cards or loads of worksheets. They need a variety of activities to stimulate their brains and to reach them the way that they learn best.You know your children better than anyone. Choose the activities that your child
        needs — the ones that your child will love.</li>
